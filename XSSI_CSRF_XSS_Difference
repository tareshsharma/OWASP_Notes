XSSI_CSRF_XSS_Difference

XSSI are by name close to Cross-Site Scripting [6] (XSS) and from the description close to Cross-Site Request Forgery [7] (CSRF). The commonality between the three is that they are all client-side attacks. The difference to XSS is easy: during an XSS malicious code is placed into a victim’s page, during an XSSI victim’s code is included in a malicious page. On the surface XSSI and CSRF look similar, because in both a request is sent from a malicious page to a different domain and in both cases the request is executed in the context of the logged in user. The key difference is the goal. In a CSRF, the attacker wants to execute state-changing actions inside a victim’s page, like transferring money in an online banking application. In an XSSI the attacker wants to leak data cross-origin, in order to then execute one of the aforementioned attacks.
